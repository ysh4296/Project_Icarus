## Project Icarus

Icarus is a web game that applies interactions within a physics system. The game is currently under development, so please look forward to the final product!

## Physics Engine

1. making object

   - represent object with vectors
   - basic collision detection
   - positional correction to resolve collision

   ![basic_collision](./demo/basic_collision.gif)

2. add boundness

   - add matter to object
   - collision resolve with boundness & friction

   ![boundness](./demo/boundness.gif)

3. add rotational force

   - add rotational inertia to object
   - collision resolve with inertia & matter

   ![rotational_force](./demo/rotational_force.gif)

## Fluid Engine

1. make particle based fluid

   - fluid action based with density
   - rust with web assembly

   ![rust](./demo/rust.gif)
